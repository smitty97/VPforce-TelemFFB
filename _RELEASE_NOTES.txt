This is not an exhaustive change log (see github for that).  This file only outlines the new/improved/changed functionality for new commits
############################################
##  January 1, 2025
############################################
## General
- It is now possible to bind and use button presses from the master instance to control force trim functions in the pedal/collective instances
  - In the force trim settings for the respective device, enable the "use buttons from master" option and then bind your button(s).
- Fix some UI sizing issues
## MSFS
- (FS24) Fixed state detection during avatar walkaround for telemetry/effect pausing


############################################
##  December 13, 2024
############################################
## General
- General UI optimization
  - Lighter weight UI theme
  - Effect IDs visible in effects monitor (to match effect IDs visible in configurator debug tab)
  - More robust geometry saving
- "Keep forces on Pause" feature now honors all active spring/damper/inertia/friction effects
## DCS
- Option added in system settings to disable export script checking/auto-install for those using non-standard save games locations
## IL-2
- Improved effect management during IL2 game window focus loss
- Added IL-2 system settings option to leave effects running during window focus loss.  Can assist with effect tuning but may lead to odd behavior and/or stuck effects
- Added discrete effect settings for gunfire/rocket/bomb (was previously a single "weapon release" effect)
## MSFS
- Work around *some* of the active telemetry issues in MSFS2024 when in menus, avatar mode and cinematic cut scenes
- Added many basic profiles for default MSFS2024 aircraft
- "Axis Control" now enabled by default

############################################
##  November 3, 2024
############################################
## General
- Fix device PID/Ident check when selecting configurator profiles for child devices from the master instance window
## MSFS
- Fix collective initialization in HPGHelicopter type
############################################
##  October 31, 2024
############################################
## General
- ***Soft require firmware v 1.0.17***
  - MSFS Dynamic forces effect and "new" g-force effect (all sims) are now using features introduced in the 1.0.17 firmware
- Fixes
  - Fix crash on startup when device PID is wrong or device is disconnected
  - Fix device gains read during startup being pushed to device on every settings change
## All Sims
- Enhanced "new g-force" effect
  - Effect now uses the spring center, rather than true center to determine applied gain.  Works better in aircraft with displaced centers and helicopters.  Also accounts for offset center due to trim
- New generic "Collective Force Trim"
  - Available in helicopters for MSFS/X-Plane/DCS
  - Trim release/reset and hat trim bindings available
## MSFS
- Improved dynamic forces effect.  Eliminated issue that was producing oscillations due to g-force component of the effect

############################################
##  October 6, 2024
############################################
## General
- Updated many effects to work properly with pedals axis.  "Direction" was hard coded for y axis which does not exist for pedals.
## DCS
- Remove bad damage telemetry from Mi-24 causing random activation of the damage effect
## MSFS
- Fix issue that would cause trouble with cyclic spring initialization when the sim freezes or pauses while the trim release button is being held.
- Improve AFCS following logic for HPGHelicopter class
- New 'SASHelicopter' class to support 2-axis SAS that will be supported on upcoming 'heliSAS' mods from SimFocus.

############################################
##  September 8, 2024
############################################
## General
- Configurator gains learned at startup no longer restored upon exit unless enabled in system settings
## DCS
- CH47 - Enable door gunner to trigger weapons effect
- Add G-Force effect as optional for helicopters (was not previously available)
## DCS/IL2/MSFS/XPLANE
- New G-Force effect for fixed wing aircraft
 - The original effect worked OK, but the "curvature" of the applied force would often lead to oscillations or a jerky feeling
 - The new effect uses a linear calculation based on the min/max G settings to determine the primary force factor
  - The physical stick deflection is then used as a factor to determine the final applied force.  For any given g-loading, "the harder you are pulling, the more force you will feel"
  - The range of stick deflection that results in %100 applied force is adjustable
  - Allows for negative G effect also.
 - For DCS/IL2, If both the *new* and *old* effects are enabled at the same time, the new effect takes precedence.  The legacy effect was not previously available for MSFS/XPLANE.
############################################
##  August 11, 2024

# Release - June 22, 2024
## QoL Improvements
- New system tray implementation (see manual)
  - TelemFFB can now be sent to system tray on startup and/or close button.  Window can be recalled by double-clicking the tray icon or from the icon right-click context menu
  - System tray icon color indicates simulator run/pause/error state like the existing status icons
  - Configuration errors (such as enabling MSFS force trim and having no binding configured) now present the error message in the UI, and generate a system tray notification for easier recognition of the issue.
- Real-time settings usability improvements
  - Values update in near real-time when manipulating sliders
  - Manipulating sliders no longer causes a form re-load
  - -/+ buttons added to left/right of slider for single step adjustments
    - Shift+Scroll wheel or left/right up/down arrow keys while hovering mouse of the slider is also supported
- Minor UI overhaul
  - Look and feel updates with on/off sliders in lieu of checkboxes and improved icons.
## General
- Configurator effect slider overrides (see manual)
  - Now you can directly modify, in real-time, the slider gain setting for any of the effect types *without* creating and pushing a separate vpconf file
  - Can be overridden on a per Sim/Aircraft Class/Specific Aircraft basis
- Minor enhancement to gear and canopy movement effects.  You will feel a bump/clunk when the gear fully extend/retract or when the canopy (when applicable) closes
## MSFS
- Improved/Simplified settings for adjusting dynamic spring forces (see manual)
  - Prior "Gain" setting is removed and the "Max Force" setting is now affixed to the aircraft "Vne" speed (learned via telemetry) while maintaining true dynamic forces based on aerodynamic conditions.
  - "Expo" adjustment to adjust the rate at which the force falls off at low speeds.
  - RTFM for the best experience using these new settings.
## DCS
- Added tail-hook movement effect (supported on a/c with tailhooks)
- Added wing-fold effect (F/A-18, F-14)
- Added fuel-boom effect (supported on all a/c with fuel boom/door)
- Added Co-Pilot/RIO Spring Override feature
  - Can temporarily override/disable spring force when user has moved away from pilots seat.  Optionally can bind a button that must also be held down.
  - Note that seat data is not available at this time for some aircraft (like the F-4E).

############################################
## Patch 3 - May 26, 2025
- Fix stick shaker is enabled by default.  Causing it to activate for helicopters (which have no mechanism in UI to turn it off since the effect does not apply to helicopters)
## Patch 2 - May 25, 2024
- Fix issue with stick shaker effect playing on ground with DCS F-4E
## Patch 1 - May 25, 2024
- Fix issue loading app when device disconnected or configured/default PID is incorrect

### DCS F-4E Maintenance Release
- Added telemetry hooks needed to enable the damage effect
- Added 'stick/pedal' shaker effect
  - Disabled by default but set-up in F-4E profile to activate at 22.3deg AoA
  - Is only a pedal feature IRL for the F-4E, but can be enabled on joystick and/or pedals
- Disabled for default F-4E profile as they conflict with HB's native implementation of each:
  - G-force effect
  - Gear Buffeting
  - Stall Buffeting
  - Speedbrake Buffeting
  - Afterburner Rumble

############################################
##  May 19, 2024
############################################
## General/System:
- Major code refactoring and re-organization of code
 - NOTE: *** Users running from python natively will need to re-run the requirements.txt pip install or manually install the "stransi" python library ***
 - NOTE: *** The format of the system settings in the registry has changed, thus you will need to re-configure your TelemFFB system settings. ***
 - Distribution structure has been changed.  You will again notice some subfolders that contain the compiled python libraries and other supporting files.  This was done to aid in reducing false positive malware detection.

- New Global "vpconf" profile option
 - Can set the "startup profile" in system settings to use as a default configurator profile if the profile was changed by an aircraft and there is no profile defined for the newly loaded aircraft
 - See manual section 4.2.10
- New option to prune log archive zips after a configurable time threshold


## IL-2
- Fixed issue where sim constantly sends stale telemetry after crash or in MP map, causing effects to play forever

## DCS
- Added **basic** support and default profile for the F-4E
- New "Spring Override" feature to better support popular community mods or other aircraft that do not support FFB
 - Implements identical functionality to what is traditionally accomplished with "Sticky Spring" and "Hardware Trim" in configurator
 - Supports force trim and hat/button based trim.
 - See manual section 4.2.6.2.5
- Add damage effect support for OH-6 and A-4 community mods

## DCS/MSFS
- New acceleration vector based "touch down" effect.  Creates a sharp forward force on the stick when touching down.  The harder you hit, the more force is applied (with configurable limits)

## MSFS
- Nosewheel Shimmy effect enhancements:
 - Fixed effect playing while applying brakes while airborn
 - Fixed effect playing while stationary on the ground with a headwind
 - Enhanced nosewheel shimmy so the shake frequency is higher at higher speeds and reduces as speed decreases
- Enhanced dynamic simconnect subscription capabilities
 - A2A Comanche now uses acceleration vector data directly from the AccuSim flight model.  This should fix the long-standing "shifting stick position" issue.
   - Requires latest update from A2A (v1.5.0 or later)

############################################
##  May 3, 2024
############################################
## Hotpatch
- DCS | Add basic support for OH-6A Community Mod


############################################

############################################
##  March 31, 2024
############################################
- **"Run Anything"**
 - New feature that will allow you to kick off any shell command when an aircraft loads (or SIM or Aircraft Category).

## MSFS:
- **Dynamic SimConnect Subscriptions**
 - Some 3rd party aircraft use alternate "L:Vars" for certain pieces of data that various effects use.  This renders the applicable effects either inoperable or inaccurate.
 - This new functionality allows us to dynamically replace a given piece of telemetry with the L:var that is needed to retrieve the applicable data from a given aircraft.
 - The only *known* aircraft today are the A2A Comanche and the B206/B47 from FlyInside.  These simconnect re-subscriptions are baked into this release, however this new feature will allow us to accommodate more aircraft in the future without the need to modify the underlying effects code.
- **[HPG Helicopters] - Trim Release Damper for the Collective Axis**
 - Similar to the Cyclic trim release damper setting that was in the previous release, this adds the same concept for the HPG collective axis when the TR button is depressed.
## DCS:
- **New, more accurate Airspeed Telemetry**
 - It was recently discovered that both the 'TAS' and 'IAS' data that comes directly from the sim is inaccurate in several ways.  The 'TAS' data seems to be more in line with ground speed.  Th "IAS" data, while more accurate, seems to include a fixed value, regardless of heading, that is somewhere around 2x the current wind speed.
   - Given the above inaccuracies, with most effects leveraging the 'TAS' data, you may have noticed odd behavior of effects like ETL.
   - In this version, we are calculating the "true" TAS by using the aircraft velocity vectors and the wind vectors to determine the aircraft's actual speed through the air mass.  This has given us a much more accurate data set than was previously available from the sim.
- **Helicopter Trim Release Damper**
 - This is **not** a replacement of the in-game trim release functionality.  It is a simple spring based dampening effect, identical to the one for MSFS.
 - To configure, simply enable the effect and bind the same button that you have configured for TR in the sim.  While the button is depressed, TelemFFB will add the dampening effect and will remove it when the button is released.  The actual trimming and centering offset is still completely handled by DCS.
## IL-2:
- **Improved effects handling when game window loses focus**
 - IL-2 does some strange things, including a "kill all" when the window loses focus.  This update improves on the TelemFFB handling of this scenario

############################################
##  March 16, 2024
############################################
# Hotpatch1 - Fix issue with older rhino firmware and 'GetGain' call to Rhino API
# Hotpatch2 - Fix issue when 'restore window size/position' and 'restore last tab' are enabled in system settings
# Hotpatch3 - adjust VRS effect for DCS to leverage better data for determining VRS condition based on airspeed and descent rate

############################################
##  March 15, 2024
############################################
## Fixes:
- ALL | Helicopter Overspeed shake was missing from settings UI
- IL2 | Increased intensity setting range and boosted read values for buffeting "Shaker" effect
- DCS | Fixed F/A-18 flaps deployment causing pedal trim offset
- MSFS | Fixed axis snapping to 0,0 during cyclic position initialization after un-pausing
## Enhancements:
- MSFS | Disable individual device axis sending when global "Axis Control" is enabled for MSFS
- MSFS | Add "Don't Send" option in custom simvar config for axis control in MSFS
- MSFS/X-Plane | Configurable dampening force when force trim release button is held
- IL2 | Dynamic pedal forces now supported
## New Effects:
- **Generic 'Stick Shaker' effect** (MSFS)
- ***Beta*** **Pedal AFCS integration for HPG H145/H160**
 - Requires latest dev builds from the HPG discord
- ***Experimental*** **VRS effect for helicopters**
 - Define the airspeed threshold below which VRS can occur
 - Define the "onset" and "full" vertical descent rates where VRS will occur if under the airspeed threshold
 - Define the max intensity of the rumble effect.  Effect will start low at the onset v/s rate and linearly increase in intensity up to max at the "full" v/s rate
- **Configurable damper/friction/inertia effect override sliders**
 - Ability to enable and configure damper/friction/inertia for any given aircraft profile.  Sliders max is bound by active configurator profile settings
- ***Experimental*** **Low Hydraulics effect**
 - In concert with the above damper/friction/inertia overrides, you can define heavier settings to emulate low or loss of hydraulic pressure
 - See sections the manual for details..  ***seriously***... you need to RTFM before you play with this effect
 - Supported Sims/Aircraft:
   - MSFS - TelemFFB reads the "Hydraulic System" simvar, so theoretically any aircraft where that data is representative of a low/failure condition is supported.
   - DCS - Unique pressure gauge and/or warning light data must be tracked on a per-aircraft basis.  Limited aircraft are supported currently
     - Supported:
       - UH-1, SA342, Mi-8, Mi-24, KA-50
       - A-10C, AV-8B, F-14, F15ESE
## New App Features:
- **Startup/Shutdown Configurator Profiles**
 - Ability to select configurator profiles that will load when TelemFFB starts or exits (Configured in the system settings dialog)
- **Configurator Profile compatibility checking**
 - Validates the PID for the chosen profile matches the device you are selecting it for.  Validation is done when selecting profile and at time of push

############################################
# General
- New integrated updater app!
 - Upon startup, TelemFFB will check for available updates and, if available, prompt you to download and install.  If you proceed, TelemFFB will quit and the updater app will launch and allow you to install the update with the push of a button
    - You may optionally restart TelemFFB automatically when the update is complete
 - If you canceled the update, you can also update from the Utilities menu, or you will be prompted again the next time TelemFFB starts
 - If you find the popup annoying and *dont* want to update, you may disable the auto update prompt in your user config file by setting `ignore_auto_updates=True`
    - If you have disabled the update notifications, you may still update via the Utilities Menu
 - **Caution** - The update process will ***overwrite*** config.ini!  If you are not yet making use of a user config file, now would be a good time to start.

############################################
#General
- Added menu option to force an effects reset.  This can be useful if an effect gets stuck for some reason (sim crash for example) as an alternative to starting TelemFFB with the -r (reset) flag.  Use with caution in DCS and IL-2 as it is destructuve to any effects generated by the sim itself.
_ _
#MSFS
- **Cyclic hat-trim following for generic helicopters**
 - Follows the same setup as the trim following for fixed wing aircraft
 - Read this section in the manual for a refresher: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YL5DLkiTxlaNx_zKHEYSs25PjmGtQ6_WZDk58_SGt8Y/edit#heading=h.gebv2sue64zj
_ _
#DCS
As more people have started building DIY pedals, there are some enhancements to the handling of FFB pedals in DCS with this release of TelemFFB.
Please read this section of the manual the detailed documentation which also links to a separate section of the document for tips on setting
up DCS to avoid getting trim events meant for your joystick sent to your pedals:  https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YL5DLkiTxlaNx_zKHEYSs25PjmGtQ6_WZDk58_SGt8Y/edit#heading=h.bamrt98l8wd5
_ _
New pedal features for DCS:
- **Rudder trim for fixed wing aircraft**
- **Auto spring mode switching for Heli/Jet/Prop aircraft types (or per aircraft)**

Default Behavior is as follows:
- 'JetAircraft'
 - Pedal trimming enabled
 - Spring mode = Static
   - Static spring based on configurable spring and dampening gain

- 'PropellerAircraft'
 - Pedal trimming enabled
 - Spring mode = Dynamic
   - Dynamic force based on configurable spring and dampening gain.  Force will be applied linearly with 0 at rest, %25 at the published Vs speed and %100 at the published Vne speed.
   - In an effort to keep as much complexity out of the config as possible, these Vs and Vne values are currently hard coded for the DCS warbirds, but instructions exist in the manual for overriding or for setting up a different aircraft to use dynamic pedal forces.

- 'Helicopter'
 - Pedal trimming not supported (sorry,  I tried multiple ways but DCS is too broken in this regard for helicopters that even have pedal trimming)
 - Spring mode = Disabled
    - Configurable dampening gain is available

############################################
##  November 8, 2023
############################################
#MSFS
- Add setting `center_spring_on_pause` to center with springs during pause/slew conditions
 - If true the stick will center with spring force when the simulator enters pause or slew
- TelemFFB will now auto-detect the aircraft category and engine type for all aircraft and load the appropriate default settings if no aircraft specific entry is found
 - Still possible for data from simconnect to be inaccurate
- Added engine/prop and jet (turbine) rumble effects to 'TurbopropAircraft' type
- Fixed jet engine rumble not playing for JetAircraft type

############################################
##  November 6, 2023
#############################################
#DCS
- Extended the damage effect to support all FC3 aircraft
- Add setting to enable disable basic AoA forces effect `aoa_effect_enabled` (default=yes)

#MSFS
- Added VRS effect to HPG Helicopter class
    - new setting `vrs_effect_intensity` (%0-100, default %20)
    - will lightly shudder when on verge of VRS conditions, medium shudder when slightly into VRS, maximum shudder when VRS fully developed
- Fixed config.ini so gear/flaps/spoiler(speedbrake) effects are in the default configuration for MSFS aircraft
- Toned down the dynamic force effect on rudder pedals in non-FBW fixed wing aircraft.


############################################
##  November 1, 2023
#############################################

#MSFS
- Hot patch for HPG H145/H160 implementation which greatly improves the hands on detection
 - There is a new `hands_off_deadzone` setting that will dictate when TelemFFB will notify the helicopter that spring override is no longer active
 - previously the hands on/hands off point was a single deadzone around the center of the stick
 - now a smaller "hands off deadzone" will prevent flapping of hands on detection as the stick will need to be much closer to center to trigger "hands off" than it did to trigger "hands on"

############################################
##  October 31, 2023
#############################################

#MSFS
- New special integration with the Hype Performance Group Airbus H145 and H160 Helicopters
 - Full FFB integration with the AFCS for both the Cyclic and Collective axes (Tail rotor axis is planned)
 - Tight integration with the AFCS data provides a true-to-life experience with the Rhino
 - This was a 2-sided project with support from HPG to add necessary capabilities for TelemFFB to communicate the state of the axes for proper implementation!
 - Requires a minimum of Build 43 Patch 2 for the H160 and Build420 Patch 3 for the H145.  These patches are available in the HPG Discord.
- For a full breakdown of the capabilities and tips on setup, check out the VPforce user guide: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YL5DLkiTxlaNx_zKHEYSs25PjmGtQ6_WZDk58_SGt8Y/edit#heading=h.f30c77lc61iq
- NOTE:  If you are running from python source instead of the exe release file, we have switched to a forked version of pysimconenct to support reading/writing of L:VARS in MSFS.  As such, you will need to `pip uninstall pysimconnect` and then re-run `pip install -r requirements.txt`

   - joystick_trim_follow_gain_virtual_x            - Virtual stick x axis movement as a percentage of the physical stick movement (0-100%)
   - joystick_trim_follow_gain_virtual_y            - Virtual stick y axis movement as a percentage of the physical stick movement (0-100%)
   - rudder_trim_follow_gain_physical_x             - Physical pedal x axis movement as a percentage of the trim value (0-100%)
   - rudder_trim_follow_gain_virtual_x              - Virtual pedal x axis movement as a percentage of the physical pedal movement (0-100%)

#General
- Added release notes for tracking updates
- Added link in UI to release notes file

#DCS
- Added intensity and scaling variables for the 'wind' effect
    -wind_effect_scaling    - adjusts the overall strength of the effect
    -wind_effect_max_intensity    - sets an upper threshold vor the wind effect

#MSFS
- Auto detect Helicopter and Jet aircraft based on simconnect variable 'CATEGORY' to avoid executing
    effects that are incompatible with certain aircraft types if the module does not have a definition
    in the config file

- Added glider 'force trim' function which will allow a button binding to relieve and re-center the joystick elevator spring force, similar
    to many modern gliders

    -force_trim_enabled             - enable/disable the effect
    -elevator_force_trim            - enable/disable on the elevator axis
    -aileron_force_trim             - enable/disable on the aileron axis
    -force_trim_button              - Button number to treat as force trim button
    -force_trim_reset_button        - Button number to treat as trim reset button
